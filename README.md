This is a Discord bot that functions as a chatbot.
- It utilizes Llama AI from Hugging Face to answer questions within the Discord app
    - Also, it can echo the most recently deleted message
    - And delete a certain number of messages based on input
- Additionally, this code can be successfully hosted locally or on AWS Lambda
- Currently, working on a RAG addition to make it answer questions with context from the server
